            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi!  I'm glad you've made it to my page! I am here to help you with all your web designing needs.
                    First let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a proud El Pasoan living in the utmost edge of 
                    West Texas. In 2014 I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin and started working for a 
                    brokerage company. A few years later I started becoming interested in web development and began a 
                    self teaching course called The Odin Project. I truly enjoyed the content and as I realized there 
                    were endless opportunities in the world of coding I decided to embark on this journey and joined UT 
                    Austin's coding bootcamp. Take a look at my projects page, there you will find a variety of websites I 
                    have worked on!
                </p>
